# Equiwaste_Prototype
This prototype was developed by me and my team mate for a hackathon conducted by 
IEEE-SSIT for which we won the first prize

# Prblem Statement
Metropolitan cities face a common issue of waste management and 
find it difficult to maintain a proper system of waste segregation 
and processing. Municipalities and Treatment plants currently face 
challenges in keeping a track of wastes being picked up by workers 
along with the disposal system incorporated by various resident 
societies and industries. Put forth a solution that gives a coherent 
system to simplify the process thereby providing transparency as 
well as placing an efficient system into place.
